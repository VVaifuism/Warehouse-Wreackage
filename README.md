# Warehouse-Wreackage
The beginning of my journey to learning Unreal Engine 5. I am following a class on Udemy first, and then expanding on that knowledge to create my own fps and, hopefully, get into the video game industry. It is also a continuation of my journey to learning GitHub. This is a good place for me learn how to use it with Unreal Engine 5 considering I am unsure of what all I need to upload here, but that is a part of the journey. 

This game is supposed to be the first section of the Udemy class I am taking. It is an introduction to Blueprintsand the physics in Unreal. All it is is flying around a 
small map and shooting metal balls at objects to make them go flying. The next section will begin showing how to use C++ in Unreal. Thankfully I already have some 
experience with C++ through school.
